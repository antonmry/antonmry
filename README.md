I'm a data infrastructure engineer who gets a real kick out of building scalable 
data platforms that solve complex problems. I've spent years diving deep into Kafka, 
Flink, and Java, along with all the cloud tools we use to make these systems hum. I 
love tackling big challenges – like building reliable and scalable distributed systems 
that handle massive data volumes or optimizing performance to reduce cloud costs and 
minimize environmental impact– and I thrive on collaborating with smart teams to bring 
those solutions to life. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging data to drive 
positive impact in environmental sustainability.
