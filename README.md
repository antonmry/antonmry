# Hi, I'm Antón

![banner that says Antón Rodríguez Yuste, Data Engineer, content creator and
community organizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antonmry/antonmry/master/github_header.png)
I'm a Software Engineer focused on Data Pipelines (Spark) and Stream Processing
(Kafka Streams, Flink). Nowadays I work for [Inditex] as Data Engineer. In the
past, I worked as a specialist in Deployment Pipelines, API Management and
Advanced Orchestration in distributed systems.

I co-organize the Vigo and Coruña Java User Groups ([VigoJUG] & [CoruñaJUG]). I
also like to speak at technical conferences and contribute to open source
projects.
