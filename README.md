I'm a data infrastructure engineer who gets a real kick out of building scalable data platforms that solve complex problems. I've spent years diving deep into Kafka, Flink, and Java, along with all the cloud tools we use to make these systems hum. I love tackling big challenges – like building distributed systems to ingest hundreds of Gigabytes per second, or optimizing performance to handle massive data volumes – and I thrive on collaborating with smart teams to bring those solutions to life. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging data to drive positive impact in environmental sustainability.

## Tech Community

I know I've been very lucky so I try to contribute back sharing my learnings in
[my blog], speaking at local and international [technology conferences] and
organizing technology events, groups and other activities:

- [VigoJUG] co-organizer of the Vigo Java User Group since 2017.
- [CoruñaJUG] co-organizer of the Coruña Java User Group since 2018.
- [LaretasGeek] is a virtual panel and podcast about technology with focus on
  Java (discontinued).
- [Streaming Annotated Newsletter]: the last news and interesting articles
  about streaming platforms and processing frameworks each month in your
  mailbox (discontinued).

I've received some awards during my career:

* 2022: [Java Champion].
* 2021: [Google Developer Expert].
* 2021: [RedHat Accelerator].
